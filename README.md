Database for our modules (Free and Patreon)

- JB2A_DnD5e represents our free JB2A module. The effects.js inside is for our FXMaster "Special Effects" integration script. 
Thanks to FXMaster's author U~Man and Sequencer's author Wasp for creating these modules and providing the API for these integrations that make our animations more easily accessible ! 

Here is an excellent guide on how to use the Sequencer database in FoundryVTT :

**DISCLAIMER: Please keep in mind that this database is still a work in progress and is susceptible to some changes. We try to keep as much consistency as possible. However it doesn't always make the most sense for some entries and require some thought as to the best approach is for maximum flexibility and ease of use.**
